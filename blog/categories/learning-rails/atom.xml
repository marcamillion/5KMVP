    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is what my development environment is:</p>

<ul>
<li>13" Macbook Pro</li>
<li><a href="http://macromates.com/">Textmate</a></li>
<li>Textmate theme used by Ryan Bates on <a href="http://railscasts.com/about">Railscasts</a></li>
<li><a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a></li>
<li><a href="http://code.macournoyer.com/thin/">Thin</a> webserver</li>
</ul>


<p>For learning Rails I tried MANY things:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/">Rails Tutorial</a> (this was a nice first primer, but given that I was learning Rails from scratch the issue I had with this tutorial is that it forces you to learn <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">Test Driven Development</a> &ndash; which for me was too much to learn everything at once. So I skipped over all the Test related stuff, and picked up what I could from everything else).</li>
<li><a href="http://railsforzombies.org/">Rails for Zombies</a> &ndash; this is pretty awesome, because it doesn&rsquo;t involve Tests and takes you into the core of Rails 3 from day 1. I highly recommend this for anyone just starting Rails development.</li>
<li>I tried a <a href="http://pragprog.com/titles/rails4/agile-web-development-with-rails">few</a> <a href="http://www.manning.com/katz/">ebooks</a> &ndash; and they are nice for rounding out your knowledge (once you have a solid understanding of the Rails way) and giving you an alternative perspective, but they never quite got me to fully understanding the way things worked.</li>
<li>Asking Questions &ndash; mainly on <a href="http://www.stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a> and #RubyOnRails on <a href="http://IRC.Freenode.net">IRC.Freenode.net</a>, port 6667. Every now and then, I will ask a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4674668/how-does-the-controller-work-in-rails-3">question</a> and get a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4674668/how-does-the-controller-work-in-rails-3/4678843#4678843">WONDERFUL answer</a>. Not only did his response clear up some stuff in my mind, but I have since used his advice about looking at other live examples.</li>
<li>Bookmark and constantly refer to multiple git repositories. Specifically the Facebook competitor <a href="https://github.com/diaspora/diaspora">Diaspora</a>, <a href="https://github.com/maccman/saasy">Sassy</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/ricodigo/shapado">Shapado</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.railscasts.com">Railscasts</a> are awesome, once you have the basics under your belt. They really help you do specific stuff in Rails.</li>
<li>Just diving in. <a href="http://prod-compv.heroku.com">CompVersions</a> was my first Rails app, and it has been a steep learning curve. Very steep. But I feel MUCH more fulfilled having done everything the hard way. That approach might not work for everyone else, but that&rsquo;s what has worked for me.</li>
<li>I must confess that I never focused on <a href="http://tryruby.org/">learning Ruby</a>, but now that I have a certain foundation in Rails and a bit of Ruby under my belt, I do plan on learning more <a href="http://mislav.uniqpath.com/poignant-guide/book/chapter-2.html#section1">Ruby</a>.</li>
<li>Ironically, writing about <a href="http://sixrevisions.com/web-development/why-making-web-apps-with-rails-is-awesome/">my learnings</a> also helps. There is something about explaining that forces you to understand what you are talking about.</li>
</ul>


<p>I also had to learn (and am still learning) jQuery which I pretty much took the same approach.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://jqfundamentals.com/">jQuery Fundamentals</a> is an awesome first place to start to get your feet wet</li>
<li>As is <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/books/jquery1/">jQuery Novice to Ninja</a> from Sitepoint.</li>
<li>Ask LOTS of questions on both #jQuery on <a href="http://irc.freenode.net">Freenode</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a>.</li>
<li>Use <a href="http://www.jsfiddle.net">JSFiddle</a> to demonstrate your proofs of concept for both CSS &amp; jQuery.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sixrevisions.com">Six Revisions</a> has <a href="http://sixrevisions.com/category/javascript/">LOTS</a> of <a href="http://sixrevisions.com/javascript/10-awesome-techniques-and-examples-of-animation-with-jquery/">great</a> articles about both <a href="http://sixrevisions.com/javascript/getting-started-with-jquery/">jQuery</a> &amp; <a href="http://sixrevisions.com/javascript/6-advanced-javascript-techniques-you-should-know/">Javascript</a>.</li>
<li>Watch as many <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQVTIJBZook">JS</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LKDImgRfrg&amp;feature=relmfu">lectures</a> <a href="http://paulirish.com/2009/perf/">as</a> <a href="http://paulirish.com/2010/10-things-i-learned-from-the-jquery-source/">you</a> can.</li>
<li><a href="http://ejohn.org/apps/learn/#">Learning Advanced Javascript</a> (By John Resig &ndash; creator of jQuery) is also something that I have bookmarked and never gotten around to doing, but looks awesome nonetheless and I should probably do so one day.</li>
<li>Addy Osmani has a wonderful <a href="http://addyosmani.com/blog/essentialjsdesignpatternsupdate1/">book on Javascript patterns</a>, that is a must read.</li>
<li>This blog post by Rey Bango, has a <a href="http://blog.reybango.com/2010/12/15/what-to-read-to-get-up-to-speed-in-javascript/">plethora of useful resources</a> on JS.</li>
</ul>


<p>Here are some additional CSS resources I used in my journey:
+ <a href="http://paulirish.com/2011/dom-html5-css3-performance/">HTML5 &amp; CSS3</a> lecture by Paul Irish (member of the jQuery core team)
+ A <a href="http://leaverou.me/ft2010/#intro">WONDERFUL CSS3 Practical Introduction</a>. It really is difficult to speak too highly of this presentation, except to say that you have to see it for yourself.
+ A very straight forward <a href="http://css.maxdesign.com.au/selectutorial/">tutorial on CSS selectors</a> and the way it works.
+ It&rsquo;s also very important for you to understand the <a href="http://css.maxdesign.com.au/selectutorial/document_tree.htm">Document Object Model (DOM) tre</a><a href="http://css.maxdesign.com.au/selectutorial/document_tree.htm">e</a>
+ Here is a <a href="http://css3buttons.michaelhenriksen.dk/">nice collection of CSS3 buttons</a>, made in the likeness of Github buttons.
+ Net Tuts has a nice rundown of <a href="http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/html-css-techniques/the-30-css-selectors-you-must-memorize/">30 CSS selectors</a> that are useful.</p>

<p>I apologize if this is too much of a link dump, but people constantly ask me what resources I used to learn everything and I have not been able to point them to one comprehensive place for me. But now I can :)</p>
